Ingredients:
- 3 eggs
- 2 tsp milk or water
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- A small knob of butter

Equipment:
18cm diameter non-stick frying pan

Directions:

Step 1:
Crack the eggs into a bowl. Season with salt and pepper, add the milk or water and whisk with a fork until combined.

Step 2:
Heat the butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium until melted and foaming.

Step 3:
Pour in the egg mixture and as it starts to set on the base gently push the sides of omelette towards the centre of the pan allowing the runny egg to flow to the edge of the pan. Continue to do this until the underneath is golden and the top is softly set.

Step 4:
Using a spatula, fold the omelette in half and slide onto a plate.

Step 5:
Sprinkle with ground pepper and serve with fresh salad leaves.
